        Hey everyone! I'm Awren. I figure since we're all quarantined for at least a couple weeks we should 
        dive deeper into how technology can build community. What are your favorite books and movies? Share 
        them! See what other people are suggesting and check those out! Get your friends and family to use 
        this and have some discussions about them!
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan on keeping this registration-free. This is an ongoing project where I'm updating things as I 
        go, so bear with me if some bugs start cropping up. If you have suggestions or run into bugs I'd love 
        to hear about it! You can email me at 
        <a href="mailto:awren.nuit@gmail.com?Subject=Book%20and%20Movie%20Club" target="_top">
