          Hello and welcome to the Cozy Community Collective! This is a place to share some of your 
          favorite books, movies, and podcasts. What are some feel-good movies that boost your mood? 
          How about some books that make all the problems of the real-world seem far, far away? Got a 
          great podcast? Maybe some media to help us learn new skills? Awesome cooking resources? 
          Share them all!

          that might make this better let me know. Email me at
